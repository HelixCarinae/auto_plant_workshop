# <b>UNB Makerspace</b>: <br> Automated Plant Workshop
#### <i>Hosted by</i>: Josh Watson and Geoffrey Chenard<br><i>Funding</i>: EEF and EUS
--------------------------

### Description:
- The goal of this workshop is to create a fully automated plant capable of taking care of itself as long as it's plugged in and there's water in a reservoir.

### To Do:
- Create schematic
- Create build guide
- Link to editable fusion 360 files
- Create and post revised design
-
- Potential Revisions:
  - Might have to replace the 2n2222a for the pump with an AO3400 or other MOSFET
  - Add pull-up resistors for transistor/MOSFET
  - Add reverse current diode for pump [probably not too important]
  - Add smoothing capacitor for pump
  - Potentially add current limiting / pullup resistor for pump
  - Modify tolerances for LED Holder and the Arm
  - Modify the electronics holder so the fit better, add holder for perfboard


### Materials:
- 1 x Arduino Nano
- 1 x 2n2222A NPN Transistor
- 3 x 3 W LED grow lights
- 3 x 100 ohm 1/4 W resistors
- 1 x 1K ohm resistor
- 1 x 10K ohm resistor
- 1 x Small perfboard
- 1 x 1/8" PVC tubing cut to length
- 1 x Soil Hygrometer
- 1 x AO3400 NPN MOSFET [Or possibly another 2n2222A]
- 1 x 3D printed pot
- 1 x 3D printed LED holder
- 1 x 3D printed LED holder arm
- 1 x Misc wire
- 1 x ??? mF capacitor
- 1 x ??? Diode
- 1 x Mini USB cable to upload the code and power the Nano
