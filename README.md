- 1 x 1K ohm resistor
- 1 x 10K ohm resistor
- 1 x Small perfboard
- 1 x 1/8" PVC tubing cut to length
- 1 x Soil Hygrometer
- 1 x AO3400 NPN MOSFET [Or possibly another 2n2222A]
- 1 x 3D printed pot
- 1 x 3D printed LED holder
- 1 x 3D printed LED holder arm
- 1 x Misc wire
- 1 x ??? mF capacitor
- 1 x ??? Diode
- 1 x Mini USB cable to upload the code and power the Nano
